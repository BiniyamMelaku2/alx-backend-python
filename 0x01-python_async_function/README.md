* [random.uniform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform)

## General

* Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x)
* All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
* All your modules should have a documentation
* All your files must be executable


## Tasks

## [0. The basics of async](./0-basic_async_syntax.py)
Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (`max_delay`, with a default value of 10) named `wait_random` that waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.

Use the `random` module.
